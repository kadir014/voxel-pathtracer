# Features
- Real-time
- Global illumination via Monte Carlo Path Tracing
- Voxel world traversal accelerated with DDA
- Low-Discrepancy Bluenoise sampler
- Temporal frame accumulation with reprojecting
- Filmic tonemapping
- Color grading postprocessing
- Simple PBR-ish material pipeline with texture maps
  - Albedo, diffuse, emission, specular and roughness.
- Custome skydome
- Russian Roulette path termination
- Anti-aliasing with jitter sampling or FXAA

**Roadmap:**
- Disney BRDF
- Procuderal sky / atmosphere model
- Octree acceleration
- Transparent objects & transmission
- Volumetrics
- Denoising
- Next event estimation (NEE)
- Multiple importance sampling (MIS)



# Running
You need Python 3.11+. After cloning the repo, install required packages:
```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then just run `main.py`. You can edit `src/common.py` to adjust common settings.
```shell
$ python main.py
```
