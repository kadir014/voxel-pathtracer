# Features
- **Real-Time Voxel Path Tracing**
  - Monte Carlo global illumination with multiple bounces
  - Accelerated voxel traversal via DDA algorithm
  - Russian Roulette termination for unbiased energy conservation

- **Sampling & Image Stability**
  - Low-discrepancy blue noise sampling
  - Temporal accumulation with reprojection for noise reduction
  - Multiple anti-aliasing methods like FXAA and subpixel jitter

- **Physically-Based Materials**
  - Unified PBR pipeline inspired by UE4's model
  - Real-time & artistic efficiency
  - Texture maps for each property such as albedo, metallic, roughness, ...

- **Post-Processing Pipeline**
  - Filmic tonemapping
  - Color grading
  - Chromatic aberration
  - Upsampling

- **Environment**
  - Skydome texture as evironment map
  - Emissive materials as light sources

### Roadmap
- Procuderal sky generation
  - Somewhat physically correct atmosphere model
  - Volumetric clouds (realistic & stylistic)
- Octree acceleration for world traversal
- Transparent objects & transmission (Disney BSDF?)
- Volumetrics
- Denoising
- Next event estimation (NEE)
- Multiple importance sampling (MIS)



# Running
You need Python 3.11+. After cloning the repo, install required packages:
```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then just run `main.py`. You can edit `src/common.py` to adjust common settings.
```shell
$ python main.py
```
